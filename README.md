# NATAS   üòäüòä

# Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at **http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org** where X is the level number. There is no SSH login.

**To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.**

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up.

# Start here:

Username: natas0\
Password: natas0\
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

# LEVEL 0

Once we are logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the screen ie, it is showing that **you can find the password for the next level on this page** Thats it..Nothing else. And you have to find the password for entering into the next level. After searching the web page thoroughly I have gone to the view page source ... then I got the password showing that the password for the next level is ****@@##%$$%^&&**(&^%%$ like this.......

**What u want....password** try it and get it....üòÇü§£



# LEVEL 0 ‚û† LEVEL 1


Once we are logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the screen ie, it is showing that **You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!** 
Thats it ...Nothing else . You have to go to the view command on thw window of the web page there it will show a developer option , there u will get view source click on it..it will open the source code of that page and finally u will get the password -- **@#$%^&*((&^%$#** that will help you to get enter into the next level...

PASSWORD :  **nahhhhhahahaa**üòÇü§£üòÇ


# LEVEL 1 ‚û† LEVEL 2

Once ur logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the server ie, **There is nothing on the webpage** . After viewing the source page of that level it is showing that it is containing a png file. To open that I have add /files after the main urls which ur working on it. After viewing that site a new page appears that is **Index of /files** it contains two file ... one is the **pixel.png** file and other is the **user.txt** file. 
After opening the user.txt file it is showing the password for the next level....

PASSWORD : **@#$%^&*(&^%%$**


# LEVEL 2 ‚û† LEVEL 3

Once ur logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the server ie, **There is nothing on the webpage** Again...in this level the same hint is showing .
**‚ÄúNot even Google will find it this time‚Ä¶‚Äù** is our hint here. If you have some idea of HTML, and about web servers, then you would know that the files it‚Äôs referring too is **robots.txt**. When u go to that url using **robots.txt** at last it will display 
User-agent: *\
Disallow: /s3cr3t/\
Then, so the robots.txt is disallowing crawlers to find /s3cr3t/. Let‚Äôs go ahead and add it to the end of the webpage, which should look something like this: http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/. 
After clicking on the above link it will open a page named **Index of /s3cr3t/** and it is showing a file named **user.txt**.
After opening this file it will show the password of the next level.

PASSWORD : **@#$%^&*()(*&^%**

# LEVEL 3 ‚û† LEVEL 4

Once ur logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the server ie, **Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"** ..
So after seeing that I have searched in google, it shows that we have to change the HTTP Referer to natas5 using a web security tools . Then only we can get access to the page where the password id stored.
