# NATAS   ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

# Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at **http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org** where X is the level number. There is no SSH login.

**To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.**

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up.

# Start here:

Username: natas0\
Password: natas0\
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

# LEVEL 0

Once we are logged in, the level hint will appear in the middle of the screen ie, it is showing that **you can find the password for the next level on this page** Thats it..Nothing else. And you have to find the password for entering into the next level. After searching the web page thoroughly I have gone to the view page source ... then I got the password showing that the password for the next level is ****@@##%$$%^&&**(&^%%$ like this.......

**What u want....password** try it and get it....ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£



# LEVEL 0 âž  LEVEL 1
