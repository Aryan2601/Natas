# NATAS

# Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at **http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org** where X is the level number. There is no SSH login.

**To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.**

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up.

# Start here:

Username: natas0
Password: natas0
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
